# Getting Started

This section contains exercises designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts of Python programming. Each exercise is intended to introduce you to essential tasks and basic Python syntax.

For a comprehensive tutorial on Python, check out my [Python Programming 101](https://joj-macho.github.io/workspace/python). This guide is designed to help you learn and use Python, starting from foundational concepts to advanced application development.


## Exercises

- [Check Basic Computer Information](check_basic_computer_info.py): Use the `platform` module to retrieve and display basic computer information such as machine type, processor, and operating system.
- [Check Current Date and Time](check_date_time.py): Retrieve and display the current date and time using the `datetime` module.
- [Check Environment Variables](check_env_variables.py): Access and print environment variables using the `os` module.
- [Operating System Information](check_os_info.py): Use the `os` module to check and display detailed operating system information.
- [Check Python Version](check_python_version.py): Check the version of Python that is currently installed and being used to run your scripts.
- [Creating Variables](creating_variables.py): Learn how to create and use variables in Python.
- [Python Identifiers](python_identifiers.py): Learn about Python identifiers and naming conventions.
- [Python Keywords](python_keywords.py): Get familiar with Python keywords and their usage.

## Additional Resources

For a more in-depth overview on getting started with Python Programming, I recommend checking out my comprehensive tutorial on [Getting Started with Python Programming](https://joj-macho.github.io/workspace/python/getting-started). This detailed resource covers fundamental programming concepts, the significance of learning Python, its diverse applications, various Python domains, and more. Additionally, you may find a tutorial on [Setting Up Your Python Programming Environment](https://joj-macho.github.io/workspace/python/setting-up) valuable. It walks you through the process of installing Python, understanding the Python interpreter, running your first program, selecting an editor or IDE for Python, and exploring the Python learning ecosystem. Also, check out [Python Definitions and Concepts](https://joj-macho.github.io/workspace/python/definitions-and-concepts) for key Python terms and concepts.

For more detailed explanations and examples, refer to the official [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).
