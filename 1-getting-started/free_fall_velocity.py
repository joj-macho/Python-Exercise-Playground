Exercise: Free Fall Velocity

This script determines how quickly an object is travelling when it hits
the ground after falling from a given height using the formula:

Formula:
    v = sqrt(2 * g * h)
where:
    - v is the final velocity.
    - g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2 on Earth).
    - h is the height in meters

Usage:
    Call the function with the height value.

    Calculates the final velocity of an object in free fall.

    Parameters:
        height (float): Height from which the object falls in meters.

    Returns:
        float: Final velocity of the object in meters per second.
