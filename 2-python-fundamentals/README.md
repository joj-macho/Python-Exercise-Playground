# Python Fundamentals

This section covers decision making and repetitions (loops), essential for controlling the flow of your programs. Each exercise is intended to help you understand and practice these fundamental programming concepts.

For a comprehensive tutorial on Python, check out my [Python Programming 101](https://joj-macho.github.io/workspace/python). This guide is designed to help you learn and use Python, starting from foundational concepts to advanced application development.


## Exercises

- [If Statements](if_statements.py): Learn how to use if statements to make decisions in your programs.
- [For Loops](for_loops.py): Understand how to use for loops to iterate over sequences.
- [While Loops](while_loops.py): Learn how to use while loops for repeated execution as long as a condition is true.
- [Nested Loops](nested_loops.py): Learn how to use nested loops for more complex iterations.


## How to Use

- Navigate to the exercise file you want to work on.
- Open the file in your text editor or IDE.
- Follow the instructions provided in the comments within each file.
- Run the script to see the output and ensure you understand the concept.
