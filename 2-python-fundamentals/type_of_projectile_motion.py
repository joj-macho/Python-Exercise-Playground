Exercise: Type of Projectile Motion

This script determines the type of projectile motion based on initial velocity
and angle of projection.

Types of projectile motion:
    - Horizontal: if the angle of projection is 0 degrees.
    - Vertical: if the angle of projection is 90 degrees.
    - Parabolic: if the angle of projection is between 0 and 90 degrees.

Usage:
    Call the function with initial velocity and launch angle.
