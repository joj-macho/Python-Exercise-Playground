# Functions and Recursion

This section covers defining and using functions, as well as the concept of recursion in Python. Each exercise is intended to help you understand and practice working with functions and recursive algorithms.

For a comprehensive tutorial on Python, check out my [Python Programming 101](https://joj-macho.github.io/workspace/python). This guide is designed to help you learn and use Python, starting from foundational concepts to advanced application development.


## Exercises

- [Defining Functions](defining_functions.py): Learn how to define and use functions in Python.
- [Function Arguments and Return Values](function_arguments.py): Understand how to work with function arguments and return values.
- [Lambda Functions](lambda_functions.py): Learn how to use lambda functions for short, anonymous functions.
- [Recursion and Recursive Functions](recursion.py): Practice writing recursive functions and understand the concept of recursion.


## How to Use

- Navigate to the exercise file you want to work on.
- Open the file in your text editor or IDE.
- Follow the instructions provided in the comments within each file.
- Run the script to see the output and ensure you understand the concept.
