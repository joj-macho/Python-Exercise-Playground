# Python-Exercise-Playground

Welcome to the Python-Exercise-Playground repository! This repository contains a a space for Python learning and covers fundamental Python concepts and programming challenges, inspired by online platforms like LeetCode, CodeWars, Project Euler, and various Python books. These exercises are designed to help you practice and enhance your Python skills.

For a more in-depth overview on getting started with Python Programming, I recommend checking out my comprehensive tutorial on [Getting Started with Python Programming](https://joj-macho.github.io/workspace/python/getting-started). This detailed resource covers fundamental programming concepts, the significance of learning Python, its diverse applications, various Python domains, and more. Additionally, you may find a tutorial on [Setting Up Your Python Programming Environment](https://joj-macho.github.io/workspace/python/setting-up) valuable. It walks you through the process of installing Python, understanding the Python interpreter, running your first program, selecting an editor or IDE for Python, and exploring the Python learning ecosystem. Also, check out [Python Definitions and Concepts](https://joj-macho.github.io/workspace/python/definitions-and-concepts) for key Python terms and concepts.


## Exercise Playground

### [Getting Started](1-getting-started/)

This section covers fundamental concepts for beginners in Python and includes introductory scripts to help you understand essential tasks. Topics include: Checking your Python version, creating variables, using comments, Python Keywords, Python Identifiers, comments and docstrings, variables and naming conventions, literals, Python Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, etc.), and more.

### [Python Fundamentals](2-python-fundamentals/)

This section covers decision making and repetitions (loops), essential for controlling the flow of your programs. Topics include: If statements, for loops, while loops, nested loops, etc.

### [Python Lists and Tuples](3-python-lists-and-tuples/)

This section covers Python's list and tuple data structures. Topics include: Creating lists and tuples, accessing elements, modifying elements, list and tuple methods, iterating through lists and tuples, etc.

### [Python Strings](4-python-strings/)

This section covers working with strings in Python. Topics include: creating and manipulating strings, accessing and slicing string elements, string methods, formatting strings, working with multiline strings, escaping characters, and more.

### [Python Dictionaries](5-python-dictionaries/)

This section covers Python dictionaries, a key-value pair data structure. Topics include: Creating dictionaries, accessing values, adding and removing key-value pairs, dictionary methods, iterating through dictionaries, and more.

### [Python Files and Exceptions Handling](6-python-files-and-exceptions/)

This section covers file operations and exception handling in Python. Topics include: Reading from and writing to files, handling exceptions with try-except blocks, using finally for cleanup actions, raising exceptions, and more.

### [Functions and Recursion](7-python-functions-and-recursion/)

This section covers defining and using functions, as well as the concept of recursion. Topics include: defining functions, function arguments and return values, lambda functions, recursion and recursive functions, etc.
